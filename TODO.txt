- A way for a variable to be allocated before calling a function and then act as if
	it was passed in the function but be returned and not make the person
	calling the function actually declare it themselves. Something like this:
	```
	func add_strs(a:* char, b:* char, out:[256]char) -> void {
		concat(out, a);
		concat(out, b);
	}
	
	// it actually allocates new_string here(before the call) and passes a pointer to the function
	new_string:[256] char = add_strs("Hello", " World!" /* new_string is secretly passed here */);
	// the function doesn't actually return anything but acts like it does
	print(new_string);
	// prints "Hello World!"
	```


	// get address is @ instead of &
