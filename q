       These  system calls create a new ("child") process, in a manner similar
       to ffoorrkk(2).

       By contrast with ffoorrkk(2), these system calls provide more precise  con‐
       trol over what pieces of execution context are shared between the call‐
       ing process and the child process.  For  example,  using  these  system
       calls,  the  caller  can control whether or not the two processes share
       the virtual address space, the table of file descriptors, and the table
       of  signal  handlers.   These  system  calls  also  allow the new child
       process to be placed in separate nnaammeessppaacceess(7).

       Note that in this manual page, "calling process"  normally  corresponds
       to  "parent  process".   But  see  the descriptions of CCLLOONNEE__PPAARREENNTT and
       CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD below.

       This page describes the following interfaces:

       *  The glibc cclloonnee() wrapper function and the underlying system call on
          which  it  is  based.  The main text describes the wrapper function;
          the differences for the raw system call are described toward the end
          of this page.

       *  The newer cclloonnee33() system call.

       In the remainder of this page, the terminology "the clone call" is used
       when noting details that apply to all of these interfaces,

   TThhee cclloonnee(()) wwrraappppeerr ffuunnccttiioonn
       When the child process is created with the cclloonnee() wrapper function, it
       commences  execution by calling the function pointed to by the argument
       _f_n.  (This differs from ffoorrkk(2), where execution continues in the child
       from the point of the ffoorrkk(2) call.)  The _a_r_g argument is passed as the
       argument of the function _f_n.

       When the _f_n(_a_r_g) function returns, the child process  terminates.   The
       integer  returned  by _f_n is the exit status for the child process.  The
       child process may also terminate explicitly by calling eexxiitt(2) or after
       receiving a fatal signal.

       The  _s_t_a_c_k  argument  specifies  the  location of the stack used by the
       child process.  Since the child and calling process may  share  memory,
       it  is  not possible for the child process to execute in the same stack
       as the calling process.  The calling process must therefore set up mem‐
       ory  space  for  the  child  stack  and pass a pointer to this space to
       cclloonnee().  Stacks grow downward on all processors that run Linux (except
       the  HP  PA processors), so _s_t_a_c_k usually points to the topmost address
       of the memory space set up for the child stack.  Note that cclloonnee() does
       not  provide  a  means  whereby the caller can inform the kernel of the
       size of the stack area.

       The remaining arguments to cclloonnee() are discussed below.

   cclloonnee33(())
       The cclloonnee33() system call provides a superset of  the  functionality  of
       the older cclloonnee() interface.  It also provides a number of API improve‐
       ments, including: space for additional flags bits;  cleaner  separation
       in the use of various arguments; and the ability to specify the size of
       the child's stack area.

       As with ffoorrkk(2), cclloonnee33() returns in both the parent and the child.  It
       returns  0 in the child process and returns the PID of the child in the
       parent.

       The _c_l___a_r_g_s argument of cclloonnee33() is a structure of the following form:

           struct clone_args {
               u64 flags;        /* Flags bit mask */
               u64 pidfd;        /* Where to store PID file descriptor
                                    (_p_i_d___t _*) */
               u64 child_tid;    /* Where to store child TID,
                                    in child's memory (_p_i_d___t _*) */
               u64 parent_tid;   /* Where to store child TID,
                                    in parent's memory (_i_n_t _*) */
               u64 exit_signal;  /* Signal to deliver to parent on
                                    child termination */
               u64 stack;        /* Pointer to lowest byte of stack */
               u64 stack_size;   /* Size of stack */
               u64 tls;          /* Location of new TLS */
               u64 set_tid;      /* Pointer to a _p_i_d___t array
                                    (since Linux 5.5) */
               u64 set_tid_size; /* Number of elements in _s_e_t___t_i_d
                                    (since Linux 5.5) */
               u64 cgroup;       /* File descriptor for target cgroup
                                    of child (since Linux 5.7) */
           };

       The _s_i_z_e argument that is supplied to cclloonnee33() should be initialized to
       the  size  of this structure.  (The existence of the _s_i_z_e argument per‐
       mits future extensions to the _c_l_o_n_e___a_r_g_s structure.)

       The stack for the child process is specified via  _c_l___a_r_g_s_._s_t_a_c_k,  which
       points  to  the  lowest byte of the stack area, and _c_l___a_r_g_s_._s_t_a_c_k___s_i_z_e,
       which specifies the size of the stack in bytes.  In the case where  the
       CCLLOONNEE__VVMM  flag (see below) is specified, a stack must be explicitly al‐
       located and specified.  Otherwise, these two fields can be specified as
       NULL  and  0,  which causes the child to use the same stack area as the
       parent (in the child's own virtual address space).

       The remaining fields in the _c_l___a_r_g_s argument are discussed below.

       Unlike the older cclloonnee() interface, where arguments are passed individ‐
       ually,  in the newer cclloonnee33() interface the arguments are packaged into
       the _c_l_o_n_e___a_r_g_s structure shown above.  This structure allows for a  su‐
       perset of the information passed via the cclloonnee() arguments.

       The  following  table  shows  the  equivalence between the arguments of
       cclloonnee() and the fields in the _c_l_o_n_e___a_r_g_s argument supplied to cclloonnee33():

       When the child process terminates, a signal may be sent to the  parent.
       The  termination signal is specified in the low byte of _f_l_a_g_s (cclloonnee())
       or in _c_l___a_r_g_s_._e_x_i_t___s_i_g_n_a_l (cclloonnee33()).  If this signal is  specified  as
       anything  other  than SSIIGGCCHHLLDD, then the parent process must specify the
       ____WWAALLLL or ____WWCCLLOONNEE options when waiting for the child with wwaaiitt(2).  If
       no  signal  (i.e.,  zero)  is specified, then the parent process is not
       signaled when the child terminates.

   TThhee sseett__ttiidd aarrrraayy
       By default, the kernel chooses the next  sequential  PID  for  the  new
       process in each of the PID namespaces where it is present.  When creat‐
       ing a process with cclloonnee33(), the _s_e_t___t_i_d array (available  since  Linux
       5.5) can be used to select specific PIDs for the process in some or all
       of the PID namespaces where it is present.  If the  PID  of  the  newly
       created  process should be set only for the current PID namespace or in
       the newly created PID namespace (if _f_l_a_g_s contains  CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWPPIIDD)  then
       the  first  element  in the _s_e_t___t_i_d array has to be the desired PID and
       _s_e_t___t_i_d___s_i_z_e needs to be 1.

       If the PID of the newly created process should have a certain value  in
       multiple  PID  namespaces, then the _s_e_t___t_i_d array can have multiple en‐
       tries.  The first entry defines the PID in the most deeply  nested  PID
       namespace  and  each  of  the following entries contains the PID in the
       corresponding ancestor PID namespace.  The number of PID namespaces  in
       which  a  PID  should be set is defined by _s_e_t___t_i_d___s_i_z_e which cannot be
       larger than the number of currently nested PID namespaces.

       To create a process with the following PIDs in a PID namespace  hierar‐
       chy:

              PPIIDD NNSS lleevveell   RReeqquueesstteedd PPIIDD   NNootteess
              0              31496           Outermost PID namespace
              1              42
              2              7               Innermost PID namespace

       Set the array to:

           set_tid[0] = 7;
           set_tid[1] = 42;
           set_tid[2] = 31496;
           set_tid_size = 3;

       If  only the PIDs in the two innermost PID namespaces need to be speci‐
       fied, set the array to:

           set_tid[0] = 7;
           set_tid[1] = 42;
           set_tid_size = 2;

       The PID in the PID namespaces outside the two innermost PID  namespaces
       will be selected the same way as any other PID is selected.

       The  _s_e_t___t_i_d  feature  requires  CCAAPP__SSYYSS__AADDMMIINN  or  (since  Linux  5.9)
       CCAAPP__CCHHEECCKKPPOOIINNTT__RREESSTTOORREE in all owning user namespaces of the target  PID
       namespaces.

       Callers  may  only choose a PID greater than 1 in a given PID namespace
       if an iinniitt process (i.e., a process with PID 1) already exists in  that
       namespace.  Otherwise the PID entry for this PID namespace must be 1.

   TThhee ffllaaggss mmaasskk
       Both  cclloonnee()  and  cclloonnee33() allow a flags bit mask that modifies their
       behavior and allows the caller to specify what is  shared  between  the
       calling  process  and the child process.  This bit mask—the _f_l_a_g_s argu‐
       ment of cclloonnee() or the _c_l___a_r_g_s_._f_l_a_g_s field passed  to  cclloonnee33()—is  re‐
       ferred to as the _f_l_a_g_s mask in the remainder of this page.

       The _f_l_a_g_s mask is specified as a bitwise-OR of zero or more of the con‐
       stants listed below.  Except as noted below, these flags are  available
       (and have the same effect) in both cclloonnee() and cclloonnee33().

       CCLLOONNEE__CCHHIILLDD__CCLLEEAARRTTIIDD (since Linux 2.5.49)
              Clear  (zero)  the child thread ID at the location pointed to by
              _c_h_i_l_d___t_i_d (cclloonnee()) or  _c_l___a_r_g_s_._c_h_i_l_d___t_i_d  (cclloonnee33())  in  child
              memory  when  the  child  exits, and do a wakeup on the futex at
              that address.  The  address  involved  may  be  changed  by  the
              sseett__ttiidd__aaddddrreessss(2)  system  call.  This is used by threading li‐
              braries.

       CCLLOONNEE__CCHHIILLDD__SSEETTTTIIDD (since Linux 2.5.49)
              Store the  child  thread  ID  at  the  location  pointed  to  by
              _c_h_i_l_d___t_i_d  (cclloonnee())  or  _c_l___a_r_g_s_._c_h_i_l_d___t_i_d  (cclloonnee33())  in  the
              child's memory.  The store operation completes before the  clone
              call  returns control to user space in the child process.  (Note
              that the store operation may not have completed before the clone
              call  returns  in  the parent process, which will be relevant if
              the CCLLOONNEE__VVMM flag is also employed.)

       CCLLOONNEE__CCLLEEAARR__SSIIGGHHAANNDD (since Linux 5.5)
              By default, signal dispositions in the child thread are the same
              as  in  the parent.  If this flag is specified, then all signals
              that are handled in the parent are reset to their default dispo‐
              sitions (SSIIGG__DDFFLL) in the child.

              Specifying  this flag together with CCLLOONNEE__SSIIGGHHAANNDD is nonsensical
              and disallowed.

       CCLLOONNEE__DDEETTAACCHHEEDD (historical)
              For a while (during the Linux 2.5 development series) there  was
              a  CCLLOONNEE__DDEETTAACCHHEEDD flag, which caused the parent not to receive a
              signal when the child terminated.   Ultimately,  the  effect  of
              this  flag  was  subsumed under the CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD flag and by the
              time Linux 2.6.0 was released, this flag had no effect.   Start‐
              ing  in  Linux  2.6.2,  the need to give this flag together with
              CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD disappeared.

              This flag is still defined, but it is usually ignored when call‐
              ing  cclloonnee().   However,  see the description of CCLLOONNEE__PPIIDDFFDD for
              some exceptions.

       CCLLOONNEE__FFIILLEESS (since Linux 2.0)
              If CCLLOONNEE__FFIILLEESS is set, the calling process and the child process
              share  the same file descriptor table.  Any file descriptor cre‐
              ated by the calling process or by  the  child  process  is  also
              valid  in the other process.  Similarly, if one of the processes
              closes a file descriptor, or changes its associated flags (using
              the  ffccnnttll(2)  FF__SSEETTFFDD operation), the other process is also af‐
              fected.  If a process sharing a file descriptor table calls  eexx‐‐
              eeccvvee(2), its file descriptor table is duplicated (unshared).

              If  CCLLOONNEE__FFIILLEESS is not set, the child process inherits a copy of
              all file descriptors opened in the calling process at  the  time
              of  the  clone  call.   Subsequent operations that open or close
              file descriptors, or change file descriptor flags, performed  by
              either  the  calling  process or the child process do not affect
              the other process.  Note, however, that the duplicated file  de‐
              scriptors  in the child refer to the same open file descriptions
              as the corresponding file descriptors in  the  calling  process,
              and thus share file offsets and file status flags (see ooppeenn(2)).

       CCLLOONNEE__FFSS (since Linux 2.0)
              If  CCLLOONNEE__FFSS  is set, the caller and the child process share the
              same filesystem information.  This  includes  the  root  of  the
              filesystem,  the  current working directory, and the umask.  Any
              call to cchhrroooott(2), cchhddiirr(2), or uummaasskk(2) performed by the  call‐
              ing process or the child process also affects the other process.

              If CCLLOONNEE__FFSS is not set, the child process works on a copy of the
              filesystem information of the calling process at the time of the
              clone call.  Calls to cchhrroooott(2), cchhddiirr(2), or uummaasskk(2) performed
              later by one of the processes do not affect the other process.

       CCLLOONNEE__IINNTTOO__CCGGRROOUUPP (since Linux 5.7)
              By default, a child process is placed  in  the  same  version  2
              cgroup  as  its  parent.   The CCLLOONNEE__IINNTTOO__CCGGRROOUUPP flag allows the
              child process to be created in a  different  version  2  cgroup.
              (Note  that  CCLLOONNEE__IINNTTOO__CCGGRROOUUPP  has  effect  only  for version 2
              cgroups.)

              In order to place the child process in a different  cgroup,  the
              caller specifies CCLLOONNEE__IINNTTOO__CCGGRROOUUPP in _c_l___a_r_g_s_._f_l_a_g_s and passes a
              file descriptor that  refers  to  a  version  2  cgroup  in  the
              _c_l___a_r_g_s_._c_g_r_o_u_p  field.  (This file descriptor can be obtained by
              opening a cgroup v2 directory using either the OO__RRDDOONNLLYY  or  the
              OO__PPAATTHH  flag.)   Note  that  all  of the usual restrictions (de‐
              scribed in ccggrroouuppss(7)) on placing a process  into  a  version  2
              cgroup apply.

              Among  the possible use cases for CCLLOONNEE__IINNTTOO__CCGGRROOUUPP are the fol‐
              lowing:

              *  Spawning a process into a cgroup different from the  parent's
                 cgroup  makes  it  possible for a service manager to directly
                 spawn new services into dedicated cgroups.   This  eliminates
                 the  accounting  jitter  that  would  be  caused if the child
                 process was first created in the same cgroup  as  the  parent
                 and then moved into the target cgroup.  Furthermore, spawning
                 the child process directly into a target cgroup  is  signifi‐
                 cantly  cheaper than moving the child process into the target
                 cgroup after it has been created.

              *  The CCLLOONNEE__IINNTTOO__CCGGRROOUUPP flag also allows the creation of frozen
                 child  processes by spawning them into a frozen cgroup.  (See
                 ccggrroouuppss(7) for a description of the freezer controller.)

              *  For threaded applications  (or  even  thread  implementations
                 which make use of cgroups to limit individual threads), it is
                 possible to establish a fixed cgroup layout  before  spawning
                 each thread directly into its target cgroup.

       CCLLOONNEE__IIOO (since Linux 2.6.25)
              If  CCLLOONNEE__IIOO  is set, then the new process shares an I/O context
              with the calling process.  If this flag is  not  set,  then  (as
              with ffoorrkk(2)) the new process has its own I/O context.

              The  I/O  context  is the I/O scope of the disk scheduler (i.e.,
              what the I/O scheduler uses to model scheduling of  a  process's
              I/O).  If processes share the same I/O context, they are treated
              as one by the I/O scheduler.  As  a  consequence,  they  get  to
              share  disk  time.   For  some  I/O schedulers, if two processes
              share an I/O context, they will be allowed to  interleave  their
              disk  access.  If several threads are doing I/O on behalf of the
              same process (aaiioo__rreeaadd(3), for  instance),  they  should  employ
              CCLLOONNEE__IIOO to get better I/O performance.

              If  the  kernel  is not configured with the CCOONNFFIIGG__BBLLOOCCKK option,
              this flag is a no-op.

       CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWCCGGRROOUUPP (since Linux 4.6)
              Create the process in a new cgroup namespace.  If this  flag  is
              not  set,  then  (as with ffoorrkk(2)) the process is created in the
              same cgroup namespaces as the calling process.

              For further information on cgroup namespaces,  see  ccggrroouupp__nnaammee‐‐
              ssppaacceess(7).

              Only a privileged process (CCAAPP__SSYYSS__AADDMMIINN) can employ CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWCC‐‐
              GGRROOUUPP.

       CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWIIPPCC (since Linux 2.6.19)
              If CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWIIPPCC is set, then create the process  in  a  new  IPC
              namespace.  If this flag is not set, then (as with ffoorrkk(2)), the
              process is created in the same  IPC  namespace  as  the  calling
              process.

              For   further  information  on  IPC  namespaces,  see  iippcc__nnaammee‐‐
              ssppaacceess(7).

              Only   a   privileged   process   (CCAAPP__SSYYSS__AADDMMIINN)   can   employ
              CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWIIPPCC.   This flag can't be specified in conjunction with
              CCLLOONNEE__SSYYSSVVSSEEMM.

       CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWNNEETT (since Linux 2.6.24)
              (The implementation of this flag was  completed  only  by  about
              kernel version 2.6.29.)

              If CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWNNEETT is set, then create the process in a new network
              namespace.  If this flag is not set, then (as with ffoorrkk(2))  the
              process  is created in the same network namespace as the calling
              process.

              For further information on network namespaces, see nneettwwoorrkk__nnaammee‐‐
              ssppaacceess(7).

              Only   a   privileged   process   (CCAAPP__SSYYSS__AADDMMIINN)   can   employ
              CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWNNEETT.

       CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWNNSS (since Linux 2.4.19)
              If CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWNNSS is set, the cloned child  is  started  in  a  new
              mount namespace, initialized with a copy of the namespace of the
              parent.  If CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWNNSS is not set, the child lives in the  same
              mount namespace as the parent.

              For  further  information on mount namespaces, see nnaammeessppaacceess(7)
              and mmoouunntt__nnaammeessppaacceess(7).

              Only   a   privileged   process   (CCAAPP__SSYYSS__AADDMMIINN)   can   employ
              CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWNNSS.   It  is  not permitted to specify both CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWNNSS
              and CCLLOONNEE__FFSS in the same clone call.

       CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWPPIIDD (since Linux 2.6.24)
              If CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWPPIIDD is set, then create the process  in  a  new  PID
              namespace.   If this flag is not set, then (as with ffoorrkk(2)) the
              process is created in the same  PID  namespace  as  the  calling
              process.

              For further information on PID namespaces, see nnaammeessppaacceess(7) and
              ppiidd__nnaammeessppaacceess(7).

              Only a privileged process (CCAAPP__SSYYSS__AADDMMIINN) can employ  CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWW‐‐
              PPIIDD.    This   flag  can't  be  specified  in  conjunction  with
              CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD or CCLLOONNEE__PPAARREENNTT.

       CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWUUSSEERR
              (This flag first became meaningful for cclloonnee() in Linux  2.6.23,
              the  current cclloonnee() semantics were merged in Linux 3.5, and the
              final pieces to make the user namespaces completely usable  were
              merged in Linux 3.8.)

              If  CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWUUSSEERR  is set, then create the process in a new user
              namespace.  If this flag is not set, then (as with ffoorrkk(2))  the
              process  is  created  in  the same user namespace as the calling
              process.

              For further information on user  namespaces,  see  nnaammeessppaacceess(7)
              and uusseerr__nnaammeessppaacceess(7).

              Before  Linux 3.8, use of CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWUUSSEERR required that the caller
              have three capabilities: CCAAPP__SSYYSS__AADDMMIINN, CCAAPP__SSEETTUUIIDD, and CCAAPP__SSEETT‐‐
              GGIIDD.   Starting with Linux 3.8, no privileges are needed to cre‐
              ate a user namespace.

              This flag can't be specified in conjunction with CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD or
              CCLLOONNEE__PPAARREENNTT.   For  security  reasons,  CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWUUSSEERR cannot be
              specified in conjunction with CCLLOONNEE__FFSS.

       CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWUUTTSS (since Linux 2.6.19)
              If CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWUUTTSS is set, then create the process  in  a  new  UTS
              namespace,  whose identifiers are initialized by duplicating the
              identifiers from the UTS namespace of the calling  process.   If
              this flag is not set, then (as with ffoorrkk(2)) the process is cre‐
              ated in the same UTS namespace as the calling process.

              For  further  information  on  UTS  namespaces,  see   uuttss__nnaammee‐‐
              ssppaacceess(7).

              Only   a   privileged   process   (CCAAPP__SSYYSS__AADDMMIINN)   can   employ
              CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWUUTTSS.

       CCLLOONNEE__PPAARREENNTT (since Linux 2.3.12)
              If CCLLOONNEE__PPAARREENNTT is set, then the parent of the new child (as re‐
              turned  by  ggeettppppiidd(2))  will be the same as that of the calling
              process.

              If CCLLOONNEE__PPAARREENNTT is not set, then (as with ffoorrkk(2))  the  child's
              parent is the calling process.

              Note  that  it is the parent process, as returned by ggeettppppiidd(2),
              which  is  signaled  when  the  child  terminates,  so  that  if
              CCLLOONNEE__PPAARREENNTT  is  set,  then  the parent of the calling process,
              rather than the calling process itself, will be signaled.

              The CCLLOONNEE__PPAARREENNTT flag can't be used in clone calls by the global
              init  process (PID 1 in the initial PID namespace) and init pro‐
              cesses in other PID namespaces.  This restriction  prevents  the
              creation  of  multi-rooted process trees as well as the creation
              of unreapable zombies in the initial PID namespace.

       CCLLOONNEE__PPAARREENNTT__SSEETTTTIIDD (since Linux 2.5.49)
              Store the child thread ID at the location  pointed  to  by  _p_a_r_‐
              _e_n_t___t_i_d  (cclloonnee())  or _c_l___a_r_g_s_._p_a_r_e_n_t___t_i_d (cclloonnee33()) in the par‐
              ent's  memory.   (In  Linux  2.5.32-2.5.48  there  was  a   flag
              CCLLOONNEE__SSEETTTTIIDD  that did this.)  The store operation completes be‐
              fore the clone call returns control to user space.

       CCLLOONNEE__PPIIDD (Linux 2.0 to 2.5.15)
              If CCLLOONNEE__PPIIDD is set, the child process is created with the  same
              process ID as the calling process.  This is good for hacking the
              system, but otherwise of not much use.  From  Linux  2.3.21  on‐
              ward,  this  flag  could  be  specified  only by the system boot
              process (PID 0).  The flag disappeared completely from the  ker‐
              nel  sources in Linux 2.5.16.  Subsequently, the kernel silently
              ignored this bit if it was specified in the  _f_l_a_g_s  mask.   Much
              later,  the  same  bit  was  recycled for use as the CCLLOONNEE__PPIIDDFFDD
              flag.

       CCLLOONNEE__PPIIDDFFDD (since Linux 5.2)
              If this flag is specified, a PID file  descriptor  referring  to
              the  child  process is allocated and placed at a specified loca‐
              tion in the parent's memory.  The close-on-exec flag is  set  on
              this  new file descriptor.  PID file descriptors can be used for
              the purposes described in ppiiddffdd__ooppeenn(2).

              *  When using cclloonnee33(), the PID file descriptor is placed at the
                 location pointed to by _c_l___a_r_g_s_._p_i_d_f_d.

              *  When  using cclloonnee(), the PID file descriptor is placed at the
                 location pointed to by _p_a_r_e_n_t___t_i_d.  Since the _p_a_r_e_n_t___t_i_d  ar‐
                 gument is used to return the PID file descriptor, CCLLOONNEE__PPIIDDFFDD
                 cannot be used with CCLLOONNEE__PPAARREENNTT__SSEETTTTIIDD when calling cclloonnee().

              It is currently not possible to  use  this  flag  together  with
              CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD..  This means that the process identified by the PID
              file descriptor will always be a thread group leader.

              If the  obsolete  CCLLOONNEE__DDEETTAACCHHEEDD  flag  is  specified  alongside
              CCLLOONNEE__PPIIDDFFDD  when calling cclloonnee(), an error is returned.  An er‐
              ror also results if CCLLOONNEE__DDEETTAACCHHEEDD  is  specified  when  calling
              cclloonnee33().   This error behavior ensures that the bit correspond‐
              ing to CCLLOONNEE__DDEETTAACCHHEEDD can be reused for  further  PID  file  de‐
              scriptor features in the future.

       CCLLOONNEE__PPTTRRAACCEE (since Linux 2.2)
              If  CCLLOONNEE__PPTTRRAACCEE  is specified, and the calling process is being
              traced, then trace the child also (see ppttrraaccee(2)).

       CCLLOONNEE__SSEETTTTLLSS (since Linux 2.5.32)
              The TLS (Thread Local Storage) descriptor is set to _t_l_s.

              The interpretation of _t_l_s and the resulting effect is  architec‐
              ture  dependent.   On  x86,  _t_l_s  is  interpreted  as  a  _s_t_r_u_c_t
              _u_s_e_r___d_e_s_c _* (see sseett__tthhrreeaadd__aarreeaa(2)).  On x86-64 it is  the  new
              value  to  be set for the %fs base register (see the AARRCCHH__SSEETT__FFSS
              argument to aarrcchh__pprrccttll(2)).  On architectures with  a  dedicated
              TLS register, it is the new value of that register.

              Use  of  this  flag requires detailed knowledge and generally it
              should not be used except in libraries implementing threading.

       CCLLOONNEE__SSIIGGHHAANNDD (since Linux 2.0)
              If CCLLOONNEE__SSIIGGHHAANNDD is set,  the  calling  process  and  the  child
              process share the same table of signal handlers.  If the calling
              process or child process calls ssiiggaaccttiioonn(2) to change the behav‐
              ior  associated  with  a  signal, the behavior is changed in the
              other process as well.  However, the calling process  and  child
              processes  still  have distinct signal masks and sets of pending
              signals.  So, one of them may block  or  unblock  signals  using
              ssiiggpprrooccmmaasskk(2) without affecting the other process.

              If  CCLLOONNEE__SSIIGGHHAANNDD  is not set, the child process inherits a copy
              of the signal handlers of the calling process at the time of the
              clone call.  Calls to ssiiggaaccttiioonn(2) performed later by one of the
              processes have no effect on the other process.

              Since Linux 2.6.0, the _f_l_a_g_s mask must also include CCLLOONNEE__VVMM  if
              CCLLOONNEE__SSIIGGHHAANNDD is specified

       CCLLOONNEE__SSTTOOPPPPEEDD (since Linux 2.6.0)
              If CCLLOONNEE__SSTTOOPPPPEEDD is set, then the child is initially stopped (as
              though it was sent a SSIIGGSSTTOOPP signal), and  must  be  resumed  by
              sending it a SSIIGGCCOONNTT signal.

              This  flag  was _d_e_p_r_e_c_a_t_e_d from Linux 2.6.25 onward, and was _r_e_‐
              _m_o_v_e_d altogether  in  Linux  2.6.38.   Since  then,  the  kernel
              silently ignores it without error.  Starting with Linux 4.6, the
              same bit was reused for the CCLLOONNEE__NNEEWWCCGGRROOUUPP flag.

       CCLLOONNEE__SSYYSSVVSSEEMM (since Linux 2.5.10)
              If CCLLOONNEE__SSYYSSVVSSEEMM is set, then the child and the calling  process
              share  a  single  list of System V semaphore adjustment (_s_e_m_a_d_j)
              values (see sseemmoopp(2)).  In this case, the  shared  list  accumu‐
              lates  _s_e_m_a_d_j  values across all processes sharing the list, and
              semaphore adjustments are performed only when the  last  process
              that  is sharing the list terminates (or ceases sharing the list
              using uunnsshhaarree(2)).  If this flag is not set, then the child  has
              a separate _s_e_m_a_d_j list that is initially empty.

       CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD (since Linux 2.4.0)
              If  CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD  is set, the child is placed in the same thread
              group as the calling process.  To make the remainder of the dis‐
              cussion of CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD more readable, the term "thread" is used
              to refer to the processes within a thread group.

              Thread groups were a feature added in Linux 2.4 to  support  the
              POSIX  threads  notion  of  a set of threads that share a single
              PID.  Internally, this shared PID is the so-called thread  group
              identifier  (TGID) for the thread group.  Since Linux 2.4, calls
              to ggeettppiidd(2) return the TGID of the caller.

              The threads within a group can be distinguished by  their  (sys‐
              tem-wide) unique thread IDs (TID).  A new thread's TID is avail‐
              able as the function result returned to the caller, and a thread
              can obtain its own TID using ggeettttiidd(2).

              When  a clone call is made without specifying CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD, then
              the resulting thread is placed in a new thread group whose  TGID
              is  the  same as the thread's TID.  This thread is the _l_e_a_d_e_r of
              the new thread group.

              A new thread created  with  CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD  has  the  same  parent
              process  as  the  process  that  made the clone call (i.e., like
              CCLLOONNEE__PPAARREENNTT), so that calls to ggeettppppiidd(2) return the same value
              for  all  of the threads in a thread group.  When a CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD
              thread terminates, the thread that created  it  is  not  sent  a
              SSIIGGCCHHLLDD  (or  other  termination)  signal; nor can the status of
              such a thread be obtained using wwaaiitt(2).  (The thread is said to
              be _d_e_t_a_c_h_e_d.)

              After  all of the threads in a thread group terminate the parent
              process of the thread group is sent a SSIIGGCCHHLLDD (or other termina‐
              tion) signal.

              If  any  of the threads in a thread group performs an eexxeeccvvee(2),
              then all threads other than the thread group leader  are  termi‐
              nated,  and  the  new  program  is  executed in the thread group
              leader.

              If one of the threads in a thread group creates  a  child  using
              ffoorrkk(2),  then  any  thread  in  the  group can wwaaiitt(2) for that
              child.

              Since Linux 2.5.35, the _f_l_a_g_s mask must also include  CCLLOONNEE__SSIIGG‐‐
              HHAANNDD  if  CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD  is specified (and note that, since Linux
              2.6.0, CCLLOONNEE__SSIIGGHHAANNDD also requires CCLLOONNEE__VVMM to be included).

              Signal dispositions and actions are process-wide: if  an  unhan‐
              dled  signal is delivered to a thread, then it will affect (ter‐
              minate, stop, continue, be ignored in) all members of the thread
              group.

              Each thread has its own signal mask, as set by ssiiggpprrooccmmaasskk(2).

              A signal may be process-directed or thread-directed.  A process-
              directed signal is targeted at a thread group  (i.e.,  a  TGID),
              and  is  delivered  to an arbitrarily selected thread from among
              those that are  not  blocking  the  signal.   A  signal  may  be
              process-directed because it was generated by the kernel for rea‐
              sons other than a hardware exception, or because it was sent us‐
              ing  kkiillll(2)  or  ssiiggqquueeuuee(3).  A thread-directed signal is tar‐
              geted at (i.e., delivered to) a specific thread.  A  signal  may
              be  thread  directed  because  it  was  sent  using ttggkkiillll(2) or
              pptthhrreeaadd__ssiiggqquueeuuee(3), or because the thread  executed  a  machine
              language  instruction that triggered a hardware exception (e.g.,
              invalid memory access triggering SSIIGGSSEEGGVV or a floating-point ex‐
              ception triggering SSIIGGFFPPEE).

              A  call  to ssiiggppeennddiinngg(2) returns a signal set that is the union
              of the pending process-directed signals and the signals that are
              pending for the calling thread.

              If a process-directed signal is delivered to a thread group, and
              the thread group has installed a handler for  the  signal,  then
              the handler will be invoked in exactly one, arbitrarily selected
              member of the thread group that has not blocked the signal.   If
              multiple  threads in a group are waiting to accept the same sig‐
              nal using ssiiggwwaaiittiinnffoo(2), the kernel will arbitrarily select one
              of these threads to receive the signal.

       CCLLOONNEE__UUNNTTRRAACCEEDD (since Linux 2.5.46)
              If  CCLLOONNEE__UUNNTTRRAACCEEDD  is  specified, then a tracing process cannot
              force CCLLOONNEE__PPTTRRAACCEE on this child process.

       CCLLOONNEE__VVFFOORRKK (since Linux 2.2)
              If CCLLOONNEE__VVFFOORRKK is set, the execution of the calling  process  is
              suspended  until the child releases its virtual memory resources
              via a call to eexxeeccvvee(2) or __eexxiitt(2) (as with vvffoorrkk(2)).

              If CCLLOONNEE__VVFFOORRKK is not set, then both the calling process and the
              child  are schedulable after the call, and an application should
              not rely on execution occurring in any particular order.

       CCLLOONNEE__VVMM (since Linux 2.0)
              If CCLLOONNEE__VVMM is set, the calling process and  the  child  process
              run in the same memory space.  In particular, memory writes per‐
              formed by the calling process or by the child process  are  also
              visible  in  the other process.  Moreover, any memory mapping or
              unmapping performed with mmmmaapp(2) or mmuunnmmaapp(2) by  the  child  or
              calling process also affects the other process.

              If  CCLLOONNEE__VVMM  is  not  set, the child process runs in a separate
              copy of the memory space of the calling process at the  time  of
              the  clone call.  Memory writes or file mappings/unmappings per‐
              formed by one of the processes do not affect the other, as  with
              ffoorrkk(2).

              If  the  CCLLOONNEE__VVMM flag is specified and the CCLLOONNEE__VVMM flag is not
              specified, then any alternate signal stack that was  established
              by ssiiggaallttssttaacckk(2) is cleared in the child process.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       On  success,  the  thread  ID  of  the child process is returned in the
       caller's thread of execution.   On  failure,  -1  is  returned  in  the
       caller's  context,  no child process will be created, and _e_r_r_n_o will be
       set appropriately.

VVEERRSSIIOONNSS
       The cclloonnee33() system call first appeared in Linux 5.3.

CCOONNFFOORRMMIINNGG TTOO
       These system calls are Linux-specific and should not be  used  in  pro‐
       grams intended to be portable.

NNOOTTEESS
       One  use of these systems calls is to implement threads: multiple flows
       of control in a program that  run  concurrently  in  a  shared  address
       space.

       Glibc   does  not  provide  a  wrapper  for  cclloonnee33();  call  it  using
       ssyyssccaallll(2).

       Note that the glibc cclloonnee() wrapper function makes some changes in  the
       memory  pointed  to by _s_t_a_c_k (changes required to set the stack up cor‐
       rectly for the child) _b_e_f_o_r_e invoking the cclloonnee() system call.  So,  in
       cases  where cclloonnee() is used to recursively create children, do not use
       the buffer employed for the parent's stack as the stack of the child.

       The kkccmmpp(2) system call can be used to test whether two processes share
       various  resources  such as a file descriptor table, System V semaphore
       undo operations, or a virtual address space.

       Handlers registered using pptthhrreeaadd__aattffoorrkk(3) are not executed  during  a
       clone call.

       In  the  Linux  2.4.x  series, CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD generally does not make the
       parent of the new thread the same as the parent of the calling process.
       However,  for kernel versions 2.4.7 to 2.4.18 the CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD flag im‐
       plied the CCLLOONNEE__PPAARREENNTT flag (as in Linux 2.6.0 and later).

       On i386, cclloonnee() should not be called through  vsyscall,  but  directly
       through _i_n_t _$_0_x_8_0.

   CC lliibbrraarryy//kkeerrnneell ddiiffffeerreenncceess
       The raw cclloonnee() system call corresponds more closely to ffoorrkk(2) in that
       execution in the child continues from the point of the call.  As  such,
       the _f_n and _a_r_g arguments of the cclloonnee() wrapper function are omitted.

       In  contrast  to the glibc wrapper, the raw cclloonnee() system call accepts
       NULL as a _s_t_a_c_k argument (and cclloonnee33() likewise allows _c_l___a_r_g_s_._s_t_a_c_k to
       be  NULL).   In  this  case, the child uses a duplicate of the parent's
       stack.  (Copy-on-write semantics ensure that the  child  gets  separate
       copies of stack pages when either process modifies the stack.)  In this
       case, for correct operation, the CCLLOONNEE__VVMM option should not  be  speci‐
       fied.   (If  the child _s_h_a_r_e_s the parent's memory because of the use of
       the CCLLOONNEE__VVMM flag, then no copy-on-write duplication occurs  and  chaos
       is likely to result.)

       The  order  of  the  arguments also differs in the raw system call, and
       there are variations in the arguments across architectures, as detailed
       in the following paragraphs.

       The  raw  system  call interface on x86-64 and some other architectures
       (including sh, tile, and alpha) is:

           lloonngg cclloonnee((uunnssiiggnneedd lloonngg _f_l_a_g_s,, vvooiidd **_s_t_a_c_k,,
                      iinntt **_p_a_r_e_n_t___t_i_d,, iinntt **_c_h_i_l_d___t_i_d,,
                      uunnssiiggnneedd lloonngg _t_l_s));;

       On x86-32, and several other  common  architectures  (including  score,
       ARM,  ARM  64,  PA-RISC, arc, Power PC, xtensa, and MIPS), the order of
       the last two arguments is reversed:

           lloonngg cclloonnee((uunnssiiggnneedd lloonngg _f_l_a_g_s,, vvooiidd **_s_t_a_c_k,,

                     iinntt **_c_h_i_l_d___t_i_d));;

       On the cris and s390 architectures, the order of the  first  two  argu‐
       ments is reversed:

           lloonngg cclloonnee((vvooiidd **_s_t_a_c_k,, uunnssiiggnneedd lloonngg _f_l_a_g_s,,
                      iinntt **_p_a_r_e_n_t___t_i_d,, iinntt **_c_h_i_l_d___t_i_d,,
                      uunnssiiggnneedd lloonngg _t_l_s));;

       On the microblaze architecture, an additional argument is supplied:

           lloonngg cclloonnee((uunnssiiggnneedd lloonngg _f_l_a_g_s,, vvooiidd **_s_t_a_c_k,,

                      uunnssiiggnneedd lloonngg _t_l_s));;

       The  argument-passing conventions on blackfin, m68k, and sparc are dif‐
       ferent from the descriptions above.  For details, see the  kernel  (and
       glibc) source.

   iiaa6644
       On ia64, a different interface is used:

           iinntt ____cclloonnee22((iinntt ((**_f_n))((vvooiidd **)),,

                        iinntt _f_l_a_g_s,, vvooiidd **_a_r_g,, ......
                     //** ppiidd__tt **_p_a_r_e_n_t___t_i_d,, ssttrruucctt uusseerr__ddeesscc **_t_l_s,,

       The  prototype  shown  above is for the glibc wrapper function; for the
       system call itself, the prototype can be described as  follows  (it  is
       identical to the cclloonnee() prototype on microblaze):

           lloonngg cclloonnee22((uunnssiiggnneedd lloonngg _f_l_a_g_s,, vvooiidd **_s_t_a_c_k___b_a_s_e,,
                       iinntt _s_t_a_c_k___s_i_z_e,,         /* Size of stack */
                       iinntt **_p_a_r_e_n_t___t_i_d,, iinntt **_c_h_i_l_d___t_i_d,,
                       uunnssiiggnneedd lloonngg _t_l_s));;

       ____cclloonnee22()  operates in the same way as cclloonnee(), except that _s_t_a_c_k___b_a_s_e
       points to the lowest address of the child's stack area, and  _s_t_a_c_k___s_i_z_e
       specifies the size of the stack pointed to by _s_t_a_c_k___b_a_s_e.

   LLiinnuuxx 22..44 aanndd eeaarrlliieerr
       In  Linux  2.4 and earlier, cclloonnee() does not take arguments _p_a_r_e_n_t___t_i_d,
       _t_l_s, and _c_h_i_l_d___t_i_d.

BBUUGGSS
       GNU C library versions 2.3.4 up to and including 2.24 contained a wrap‐
       per  function  for  ggeettppiidd(2)  that  performed  caching  of PIDs.  This
       caching relied on support in the glibc wrapper for cclloonnee(), but limita‐
       tions  in the implementation meant that the cache was not up to date in
       some circumstances.  In particular, if a signal was  delivered  to  the
       child immediately after the cclloonnee() call, then a call to ggeettppiidd(2) in a
       handler for the signal could return the  PID  of  the  calling  process
       ("the parent"), if the clone wrapper had not yet had a chance to update
       the PID cache in the child.  (This discussion ignores  the  case  where
       the  child was created using CCLLOONNEE__TTHHRREEAADD, when ggeettppiidd(2) _s_h_o_u_l_d return
       the same value in the child and in the  process  that  called  cclloonnee(),
       since  the  caller  and  the  child  are in the same thread group.  The
       stale-cache problem also does not occur if the _f_l_a_g_s argument  includes
       CCLLOONNEE__VVMM.)   To  get  the truth, it was sometimes necessary to use code
       such as the following:

           #include <syscall.h>

           pid_t mypid;

           mypid = syscall(SYS_getpid);

       Because of the stale-cache problem, as well as other problems noted  in
       ggeettppiidd(2), the PID caching feature was removed in glibc 2.25.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       The following program demonstrates the use of cclloonnee() to create a child
       process that executes in a separate UTS namespace.  The  child  changes
       the  hostname in its UTS namespace.  Both parent and child then display
       the system hostname, making it possible to see that the  hostname  dif‐
       fers  in the UTS namespaces of the parent and child.  For an example of
       the use of this program, see sseettnnss(2).

       Within the sample program, we allocate the memory that is  to  be  used
       for  the child's stack using mmmmaapp(2) rather than mmaalllloocc(3) for the fol‐
       lowing reasons:

       *  mmmmaapp(2) allocates a block of memory that starts on a  page  boundary
          and  is  a  multiple of the page size.  This is useful if we want to
          establish a guard page (a page with protection PPRROOTT__NNOONNEE) at the end
          of the stack using mmpprrootteecctt(2).

       *  We can specify the MMAAPP__SSTTAACCKK flag to request a mapping that is suit‐
          able for a stack.  For the moment, this flag is a  no-op  on  Linux,
          but it exists and has effect on some other systems, so we should in‐
          clude it for portability.
