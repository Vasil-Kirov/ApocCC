These are things not to do on this project.
If you do any these things you will be put in bad programmer jail.

1. Write to tokens after parsing has begun:
 - Tokens are passed as pointers for performance reasons
   since if we put tokens as values in ast nodes they will
   become very very big. All tokens should be pointers to
   the initial array that is generated during lexing

2. Write to type info structs:
 - Same as tokens.
 - This is partially ignored in x64 custom backend code generation
   so we should probably change that

3. Directly pass SD dynamic arrays to functions:
 - If you pass an SD dynamic array to a function it can resize in that function
   and then your original pointer will no longer be valid. Instead you can put
   it in a struct and then pass a pointer to that struct

4. Take a pointer to data that is in a dynamic array:
 - Pretty much the same thing as the one above,
   array resizes -> pointer points to garbage
